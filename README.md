The ANZ Australia Data@ANZ Program is provided by ANZ to offer the students opportunities to explore a career in data at an financial institution. The program helps students to gain real skills and get genuine insights into the role that data plays in helping ANZ deliver on its core purpose “to shape a world where people and communities thrive”.

The program provides student with ANZ transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers and require students to perform 2 mandatory tasks: 

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Segment the dataset and draw unique insights, including visualisation of the transaction volume and assessing the effect of any outliers.

- **Predictive Analytics**: Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes and build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer
